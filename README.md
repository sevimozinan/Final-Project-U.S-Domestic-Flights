# Final Project - U.S Domestic Flights

I did this project for IBM - Data Visualization With Python Course. I created a dashboard using plotly and dash.

So in this project, iâ€™ll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. I will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. I work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

Initially the dashboard will be empty.

When we select input, the corresponding reports are provided. We can have two reports (Airline Performance and Delay Reports)

# The Airline Performance Report

It has a treemap. (Number of flights flying to each state from each reporting airline), pie chart(Percentage of diverted airport landings per reporting airline), usa map(Number of flights flying from each state), bar chart(Number of flights under different cancellation categories), line chart(Average flight time by reporting airline)
